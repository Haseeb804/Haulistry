## 🔌 API Integration Guide

### Setup API Service
```dart
// lib/services/api_service.dart
class ApiService {
  static const baseUrl = 'https://your-api.com/api';
  final Dio _dio = Dio();
  
  Future<Response> get(String endpoint) async {
    return await _dio.get('$baseUrl/$endpoint');
  }
  
  Future<Response> post(String endpoint, dynamic data) async {
    return await _dio.post('$baseUrl/$endpoint', data: data);
  }
  
  // Add put, delete methods...
}
```

### Replace Mock Data
1. **In AuthProvider:**
   - Replace `Future.delayed()` with actual API calls
   - Store token in SharedPreferences
   - Handle authentication errors

2. **In BookingProvider:**
   - Fetch real service data from API
   - Implement pagination
   - Add error handling
   - Cache data locally

### API Endpoints Needed
```
Authentication:
POST   /auth/register
POST   /auth/login
POST   /auth/forgot-password
POST   /auth/reset-password
GET    /auth/profile
PUT    /auth/profile

Services:
GET    /services?type={type}&page={page}
GET    /services/{id}
POST   /services              (Provider only)
PUT    /services/{id}         (Provider only)
DELETE /services/{id}         (Provider only)

Bookings:
GET    /bookings?status={status}
GET    /bookings/{id}
POST   /bookings
PUT    /bookings/{id}
DELETE /bookings/{id}

Notifications:
GET    /notifications
PUT    /notifications/{id}/read

Messages:
GET    /messages
GET    /messages/{userId}
POST   /messages
```

## 🎯 Testing Strategy

### 1. Manual Testing
- Test all navigation flows
- Verify form validations
- Check responsive design
- Test on different devices

### 2. Unit Tests
```dart
// test/providers/auth_provider_test.dart
test('Login with valid credentials', () async {
  final authProvider = AuthProvider();
  final result = await authProvider.login('test@test.com', 'password');
  expect(result, true);
});
```

### 3. Widget Tests
```dart
// test/screens/login_screen_test.dart
testWidgets('Login button is disabled when form is invalid', 
  (WidgetTester tester) async {
  await tester.pumpWidget(MyApp());
  // Test widget behavior
});
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Navigation Not Working
**Solution:** Check that all routes are defined in `app_router.dart` and route names match.

### Issue 2: Provider Not Updating UI
**Solution:** Ensure `notifyListeners()` is called after state changes.

### Issue 3: Images Not Loading
**Solution:** Add images to `assets/` folder and declare in `pubspec.yaml`.

### Issue 4: Build Errors
**Solution:** Run `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get`.
